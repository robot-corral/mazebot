initial release

revision 1.1 2018-10-29

* SD Flush moved to A12 from A11 to resolve EXTI line interrupts (was sharing the same line with B11)

revision 2.0 -- WORK IN PROGRESS --

* LPUART1 is used instead of USART1 for ST-Link (PA9/PA10 are now free, PG7, PG8 are used for LPUART)
* SD Flush moved from A12 to A9 (as it is now available due to USART1 is not being used), this allows SD flush to be of lower priority as otherwise it was sharing the same IRQ as motor failure
* LED outputs pins were changed from (PG3, PG4, PG5, PG6, PG7, PG8) to (PD14, PD15, PG2, PG3, PG4, PC6) respectively
* sensors connector is straight one (not 90 degree) and is now mounted on the bottom of the board facing down
* board is made slightly more compact (sensors connector was moved closer to MCU)
