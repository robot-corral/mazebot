    # to keep stack 8 byte aligned need to store dummy register R12. R12 is chosen as, if we are going to resume a task we couldn't push/pop any registers apart from R0-R3 and R12,
    # R0-R3 are used to pass arguments in (so we couldn't modify them), so the only register left is R12.

    # - 0 if return stack is main (MSP)
    # - 1 if return stack is process (PSP)

    # true is when bit 2 is zero
    # this instruction determines how next 3 instructions are going to be executed
    # in this case it is: {then}, {then}, {else}
